          Sanjeeban here, a CSE undergrad student in SRM Institute of Science and Technology, KTR. I would like to introduce myself as a tech geek. Currently a full stack web developer, and diving into new skills and tech stacks. I look up with the motive, growth is proportional to knowledge, so I try to keep learning constant in the journey of life. Looking forward to be a good engineer, solving the problems of the society and make lives easier.
